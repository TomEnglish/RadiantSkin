  - The website I emulated was novoslabs.com

  I tried to emulate a number of the elements from their website and their overall aesthetic. I liked the page that scrolled under translucent banners and other banners that move with the page while having text scroll accross the screen. Their website has a clean, minimal, and modern design aesthetic. Thier pallate is simple and seems elegant to me with a spectrum of orange, beige background and black and white text. In other pars of their pages were some color gradient that incorporated a bit of purple.  Thier stylistic photos seems to hilight orange and purple. They have a promotional banner with discounts and buttons with calls to action. Their sit portray an image of science, vitality and premium brand quality. 
  
  They used quite a bit more media and dynamic text than me, but I beleive I was able to imulate most of the style with some similarish photos and a little dynamic text.
